The purpose of this project is to also teach myself Python, since I did not
use this language since high school. The only difference is that I am 
expanding the concepts I know by making a text-based adventure game through
the terminal. While majority of these projects are simple right now, I plan on
expanding them more after the Mat Libs game. The game focuses on the player
finding the diamond crystal that holds infinite power back to the kingdom.
The game's choices affects the entire outcome.
